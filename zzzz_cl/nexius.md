Bachelor's Degree
-
- B.Sc. from Cornell University in Electrical & Computer Engineering.

Basic understanding of IP/Ethernet and Routing/Switching technology
-
- Earned an A- in ECE 4450 Computer Networks and Telecommunication. (I have forgotten some of this stuff though. I'll need a few days to review.)
- Implemented, Verified, Benchmarked topological ring network with adaptive-routing in Verilog.
- Implemented, Verified, Benchmarked 4 CAM (Content Addressable Memory) designs using Cadence Virtuoso. CAMs are widely used to implement a router's routing tables.

Basic Understanding of Linux
-
- I have used Linux / ssh'ed into Linux for 3 semester-long projects in Computer Architecture, Computer Vision, and Digital VLSI.

Some practical experience in programming (Python, Perl) or shell scripting
-
- I have extensive programming experience in Python which I have used to write 100+ solutions to algorithm problems.
- I have also programmed in Ruby, Java, C++/C, Verilog, MATLAB, and Assembly as part of my coursework.
- Check out my [*github*](https://www.github.com/josfervi). My most recent pushes are Python solutions to Google Foobar Challenges.

A critical thinker with an eye for detail
-
- I like to think that I am a critical thinker, problem solver. I like to solve algorithmic problems for fun, for the challenge, and to gain exposure to and familiarity with a wide set of problems, approaches, and solutions so that I can apply this knowledge to new problems.

A team player who is mindful of the end-to-end picture
-
- I have worked on 5 semester-long team projects and on occasion with the same people on different teams (team members were chosen voluntarily).
- I love helping anyone and everyone, especially those in my team.
- I am patient.

An honest, clear communicator who listens, follows directions, and asks questions
-
- I am a listener, honest, and follow directions.
- I sometimes don't ask questions when I should. I am aware of this and I am working on it.
- I try my best to always remove ambiguity from communication, especially from written communication.

A passionate learner who wants to try new things and learn from every opportunity
-
- My independent coursework includes earning 100% on two MOOCS: Stanford's [*Introduction to Logic*](https://www.bit.do/stanf) and Louvain's [*Paradigms of Computer Programming - Fundamentals*](https://bit.do/louv).
- I am currently working through NVIDIA's [*Intro to Parallel Programming*](https://www.bit.do/nvidiacourse).

A willingness to travel to project locations
-
- I am very willing to travel.

Valid work authorization in the United States
-
- I am a Green Card holder. In other words, I am a US Permanent Resident.

Understanding of a wireless telecommunications network and architecture (desirable)
-
- I studied the Mathematics of Signals and Systems (Fourier analysis) so I am familiar with how FDM and AM work. I wouldn't mind learning how other techniques work, indeed I would enjoy it.
