python notes

ABOUT global
The keyword global is only useful to change or
create global variables in a local context,
although creating global variables is
seldom considered a good solution.
#
While you can access global variables without
the global keyword, if you want to assign to them
you have to use the global keyword (otherwise, you'll
be creating a local variable of the same name)

TO LOOP thru a GENERATOR gen
for item in gen:
    print( item )

TO recurse inside a generator use 'yield from'
def recursive_generator(node)
    yield node
    #
    # in Python 3.3
    yield from recursive_generator( node.right )
    #
    # in Python 2.7
    for node in recursive_generator( node.right ):
        yield node
