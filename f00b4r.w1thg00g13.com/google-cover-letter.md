## VILLEGAS JOSE Cover Letter

---
Hello,

My name is Jose Villegas and I am very interested in Google's Software Engineering Residency opportunity. 

Firstly, thank you for expressly encouraging historically underrepresented groups to apply. It  may have been just the push and encouragement that I needed in order to apply.

Secondly, allow me to address each of the requirements for this role and in doing so you can learn a little bit more about me:

### Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, related technical field or equivalent practical experience.

- I earned a **B.Sc. in Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) from Cornell University** in Aug 2016.

### Programming experience in one or more of the following languages: C, C++, Java and/or Python.

- I have programming experience with Python, Java, and C++/C. I am currently most comfortable with Python, but have been getting back into C++ as I work through [*NVIDIA's Intro to Parallel Programming Udacity course*](https://www.bit.do/nvidiacourse).

### Eligible to work in the United States.

- As a Green Card holder (a.k.a. Permanent Resident), I am eligible to work in the US.

### Expertise in data structures, algorithms and complexity analysis.

- I have solved several of the [*Google foobar challenges*](https://foobar.withgoogle.com), which, of course, involve data structures, algorithms, and complexity analysis.
- I have also **solved 100+ algorithm and data structure problems** in Python and Ruby through sites such as [*interviewbit*](https://www.interviewbit.com) and [*pramp*](https://www.pramp.com), where I have a **4.6/5 interviewer rating after conducting 19 mock interviews**.
  - As well as judging solutions for correctness, [*interviewbit*](https://www.interviewbit.com) also judges solutions for efficiency, so achieving low time and space complexities in my solutions has become a focus of mine and in doing so I have also become better at complexity analysis.
  - In a [*pramp*](https://www.pramp.com) session, two people take turns mock interviewing each other. Once the session is over, they give each other feedback. I am very thankful for [*pramp*](https://www.pramp.com) because it has helped me level up many skills, especially communication skills. I have completed 19 sessions and have consistently earned very positive feedback/ratings from my mock interview partners. Also, I always try to give very detailed, thoughtful, and actionable feedback.

### Strong work ethic and a willingness to learn.

- I love learning. I have **earned a 100% on two MOOCs** and I am working my way through a third. Here they are:
  - 100% on [*Paradigms of Computer Programming - Fundamentals*](https://www.bit.do/louv), Louvain (UTC) via [*edX*](https://www.edx.org).
  - 100% on [*Introduction to Logic*](https://www.bit.do/stanf), Stanford University via [*Coursera*](https://www.coursera.org).
  - In progress: [*Introduction to Parallel Programming*](https://www.bit.do/nvidiacourse), NVIDIA via [*Udacity*](https://www.udacity.com).
- I don't mind long days as long as I am learning and surrounded by good people. I have worked through two-weekend long hackathons (Global Game Jam and HackRealityNYC) during which I have learned to work with Unity and C#. This coming weekend (March 10-12) I will be attending my third hackathon.

### Relevant Internship work experience

- I do not have internship experience, but:
  - I worked as an Advanced Robotics and Electrical Engineering TA for Johns Hopkins University's CTY program. With the help of instructor and Googler, Marc Howard, I helped students get their Python-executing Raspberry Pi robots up and navigating around obstacles using subsumption architecture. I earned a combined **4.84/5 rating from 34 students** and high praise such as **"an unquestionable wizard at debugging."** 
  - Two teammates and I **built a Quadcore processor in code (Verilog) from scratch using Incremental Development and Test-Driven Developement**. Here is [*a high level block diagram of the Quadcore processor*](https://www.bit.do/blockdiagram). It was composed of four pipelined, five-stage logic cores, eight Two-Way Set-Associative caches, and three ring networks with adaptive routing. The **Quadcore achieved 2x to 3x throughput vs a Singlecore** that we also built.
  - Recently, I started incoorporating [*Google Python Style Guide*](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html) into my Python code and putting more emphasis on code readability.

I am very much looking forward to hearing back from you soon.

Thank you for your time,

Jose
