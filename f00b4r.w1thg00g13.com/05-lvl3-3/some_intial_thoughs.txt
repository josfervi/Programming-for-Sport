# The question can be reformulated as:
# 
# Let S(n) be the set of all sequences of monotonically decreasing positive
# integers (>0) s.t. the integers in each sequence sum up to n.
# How many such sequences are there? I.e. what is the cardinality of S(n), |S(n)|?
# 
# answer(n) == |S(n)|-1.
# The -1 is there because answer(n) wishes us to omit the sequence of length-1, namely [n].
# 
# This is a combinatorics problem.
# May need to use generating functions.
#   Turns out, yes generating functions can kind of answer this question,
#   but ended up solving the problem by using a recurrence relation.
# 
# The problem can also be reformulated as:
# 
# How many ways are there to partition n objects subject to the conditions
# that no partition is empty (i.e. that partition sizes are >0) and
# that partition-sizes decrease monotonically?
# There will |S(n)| ways and answer(n) == |S(n)| - 1.
